## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo 
2. Create a branch from `master`. Use a descriptive branch name.
3. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
4. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
5. Make sure your code is consistent
6. Create a pull request!

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

Before any pull request be sure that the code passes format, analyze and tests.
```
flutter format --set-exit-if-changed lib
flutter analyze lib
flutter test --no-pub --coverage --test-randomize-ordering-seed random
```
