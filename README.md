# Cookify App

App designed to cater the Home Chefs


## Overview
  The Cookify App will provide an open source platform to enable curated recipes to be searched and executed. 
  
  - A user would select available recipes based on basic criteria, 
  - Follow setup instructions to gather ingredients and supplies onto the cooking area, 
  - then click one button which would start the cooking experience.
  - The core cooking experience consists of following a sequence of pages with large simple text, basic illustrations, 
and a timer in the corner. 
  - The user must keep up with the instructions before the timer runs out. 
  - This information presentation structure encourages the user to keep up a specific level of intensity and timeliness to accomplish basic
cooking goals, which with performance tracking intuitively guides the user to accomplish progressively more diverse and complex recipes.
  - A performance score is tracked to reflect the userâ€™s ability to comply with the time constraints. 
  - Forward and backward buttons will enable re-traversal and acceleration of the cooking sequence for negative and positive score impacts.

## Features Overview
The Cookify App will be built in Flutter and provide the following key capabilities:

  - An automated, guided recipe execution
  - Recipe sharing into a global database (Advance)
  - Training progression
