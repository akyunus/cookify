# Cookify

**Cookbook App**

# Overview

This Cooking App will provide an open source platform to enable curated recipes to be searched and executed.
A user would select available recipes based on basic criteria, 
follow setup instructions to gather ingredients and supplies onto the cooking area, then click one button which would start the cooking experience.
The core cooking experience consists of following a sequence of pages with large simple text, basic illustrations, and a timer in the corner.
The user must keep up with the instructions before the timer runs out.
This information presentation structure encourages the user to keep up a specific level of intensity and timeliness to accomplish basic 
cooking goals, which with performance tracking intuitively guides the user to accomplish progressively more diverse and complex recipes.
A performance score is tracked to reflect the userâ€™s ability to comply with the time constraints. 
Forward and backward buttons will enable re-traversal and acceleration of the cooking sequence for negative and positive score impacts.
